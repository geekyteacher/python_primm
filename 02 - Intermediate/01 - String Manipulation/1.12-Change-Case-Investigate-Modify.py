# FORK ME or copy the code!  Please don't request edit access. This is the original so it needs to stay undedited for all users.

# Task - Investigate

# Look at the code below and answer the questions underneath.

guess = input("What is the capital of France?")

if guess.lower() == "paris":
  print("Correct!")


# What does guess.lower() do?

# What programming construct is used to check the user's answer and output a suitable message?

# Which line will be executed if the input is 'pARiS'?

# Which line will be executed if the input is 'beRLiN'?

# If guess.lower() was changed to guess.upper(), what else would you have to change to make the code work?

# Task - Modify

# Adapt the code so that it gives an 'incorrect' message is the user does not guess 'Paris'.

# Adapt the code so that it converts the answer to uppercase and gives suitable output messages.

# Adapt the code to store 'PARIS' in a variable called 'answer' and use this variable in the condition.
