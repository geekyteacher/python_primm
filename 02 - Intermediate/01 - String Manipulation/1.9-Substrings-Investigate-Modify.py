#Task - Investigate and Modify

  # Run this code and comment it to explain what it does 
  
  # Modify and complete this code so that:
  # It asks the user to enter a phrase at least 15 characters long 

  # It gets user input into the phrase variable instead of 'I love computer science'

  # It asks the user to input a number between 0 and the length of the phrase, gets the input and assigns it to the variable called 'num2' 
  
  # It outputs a slice from the phrase variable between 0 and num 2

phrase = "I love computer science"

num2 = input("enter a number between 0 and " + )

print(phrase[0:])
