#Task

  # Modify and complete the following code to make it:

# Get user input into the name variable instead of assigning 'Elizabeth'

name = "Elizabeth"

  # Get the user to input a number and store it in a suitably named variable.
  #EXTRA CHALLENGE - get the length of the name input in the previous step and ask the user to input a number between 0 and the length.

input("Enter a number")

  # Get the letter at the position of the number input and assign it to the 'letter' variable

letter = 

  # Output the letter variable
  # EXTRA CHALLENGE - combine this step with the previous one to remove the need for the 'letter' variable.
