"""
Write a program that:

Asks the user to input a word and stores it in a suitably named variable
Asks the user to input a number and stores it in a suitably named variable.
If the number entered is larger than the length of the word input then output an error message.
Else output the character from the word at the position input as part of a sentence.

Eg for inputs ‘Jimi’ and ‘2’ the program outputs ‘The letter m is at position 2 in your name’.
For inputs ‘Jimi’ and ‘6’ the program outputs ‘The number you entered is too large’
